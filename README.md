```

The main controller for public view lives in 'pages/App'. A controller can be generated via the terminal with 

```bash

   php assist new page < page Name >
```

All static files have been autoloaded in 'kernel/loadStatic.json'. Before production, we would bundle all static files and serve them from a CDN. 

```json


```

All static files, general assets are cached in 'public/Assets/assets.paths.json' and served at zero seconds.

# Landing page
You can start the development server by running:
