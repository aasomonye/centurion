# Custom
This directory contains a global header and footer file for all your views. They are introduced on every generated page also, and they provide room for assets autoloading, including meta configurations. They are responsive to changes from within a running controller. In essence, the custom files on demand could change to render a different header or footer file from an active page or an active controller.
